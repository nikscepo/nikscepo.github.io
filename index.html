                        <p>Great remote location with amazing views. Good communication with Milos and good welcome (even though we were a little late). A lovely cabin to stay in. Use a good GPS to find the place and you’ll be amazed by the wildlife.</p>

                        <h3>Amazing</h3>
                        <p>Milos's place was a really good, secluded, quiet, in the middle of nature, but everything we needed. We had a puppy with us which was perfectly happy just as we were. My full recommendation</p>

                        <p>Wow, the place is beautiful, remote, but still with everything you might need for your stay. The place is sparkling clean, our hosts welcomed us warmly and showed us around. Highly recommended!</p>
